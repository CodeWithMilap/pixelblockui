Welcome to the PixelBlockUI installation guide! This comprehensive guide will walk you through installing `pixelblock-cli`, a CLI tool designed to streamline the integration of PixelBlockUI components into your React or Next.js projects.

## Prerequisites

Before installing `pixelblock-cli`, ensure your development environment meets the following prerequisites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js installation)

## Installation Methods

### Global Installation

Installing `pixelblock-cli` globally allows you to access it from any directory on your system. To install globally, run:

```bash
npm install -g pixelblock-cli
```

After installation, verify the installation by checking the version:

```bash
pixelblock-cli --version
```

### Local Installation

For project-specific usage, install `pixelblock-cli` locally within your project directory:

```bash
npm install pixelblock-cli
```

After installation, you can run `pixelblock-cli` using npm scripts:

```json
"scripts": {
  "pixelblock": "pixelblock-cli"
}
```

Run the CLI using:

```bash
npm run pixelblock add <component>
```

### Running with npx

If you prefer not to install `pixelblock-cli`, you can use `npx` to run it directly:

```bash
npx pixelblock-cli add <component>
```

Replace `<component>` with the name of the PixelBlockUI component you want to install.

## Adding PixelBlockUI Components

Once `pixelblock-cli` is installed, you can easily add PixelBlockUI components to your project:

```bash
pixelblock-cli add <component>
```

This command installs the specified `<component>` into your project’s `components/PixelBlock` directory. It also manages dependencies required for each component, such as `clsx` and `tailwind-merge`.

## Managing TailwindCSS

PixelBlockUI components rely on TailwindCSS for styling. If you haven’t already set up TailwindCSS in your project, follow these steps:

### Installing TailwindCSS

Install TailwindCSS using npm:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss
```

Initialize TailwindCSS by creating a configuration file:

```bash
npx tailwindcss init
```

### Configuring TailwindCSS

Ensure your project uses TailwindCSS by including it in your CSS:

```css
/* src/styles/tailwind.css */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Import this CSS file into your project’s main entry file (e.g., `src/index.js` or `src/index.tsx`):

```javascript
import './styles/tailwind.css';
```

## Verification

Verify that PixelBlockUI and TailwindCSS are correctly set up by adding a component and checking for successful installation and styling.

```bash
pixelblock-cli add Button
```

Check the `components/PixelBlock` directory for the added Button component and ensure TailwindCSS styles are applied as expected.

## Next Steps

You are now ready to integrate and customize PixelBlockUI components into your React or Next.js projects. For detailed usage instructions and component documentation, refer to the [PixelBlockUI Documentation](./docs).
